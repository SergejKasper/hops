In this repo, we are experimenting with technology that might serve as our next generation front end technology stack: hops spices our brew (i.e. web front end) with [ECMAScript](https://babeljs.io) and [Flow](http://flowtype.org), [CSS Next](http://cssnext.io) and [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/)/[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)/[Redux](http://redux.js.org). To get an impression take a look at our [example app](https://github.com/xing/hops/tree/master/app).

Hops is not yet another boilerplate. Hops is a self-contained but highly extensible development and build environment that is packaged as a single module. Batteries included.

### Install

Besides recent versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), hops has no global dependencies. If you need those, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or similar.

```shell
mkdir foo && cd foo
npm init -y
npm install -SE hops
```

A postinstall script will attempt to bootstrap and configure the project hops is being installed to: after installation, you can instantly start developing.

### Running

For developing with hops, you can use any decent editor with up-to-date language support. Those without a favorite we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io) with the [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter), [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint) and [linter-stylelint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint) plugins.

```shell
npm start (--production)
```

If called without the `--production` flag, a development server with hot module replacement is started. In production mode, a static build is initialized.

### Testing

If you are developing any kind of real application, you certainly want to be able to test your code. For hops, we chose to include a rather simple testing toolchain consisting of [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

```shell
npm test
```

In hops' default configuration, all files with names ending with `.test.js` (and outside `/node_modules`) are being picked up.

### API

#### render(options: object): function|undefined

`render()` is hops' main function: it creates a [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) store, sets up [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) and handles rendering both in the browser and in node. Using it is mandatory and its output must be the default export of your main module. And it's a little magic.

```javascript
import { render } from 'hops';

import { routes } from './routes';

export default render({ routes });
```

In addition to `routes` and `reducers`, an html `mountPoint` selector and some othes may be passed as options. Please check the [defaults](https://github.com/xing/hops/blob/master/lib/defaults.js) for some details.

#### register(namespace: string[, reducer: function]): object

`register()` is a helper to streamline store/state interactions in hops based projects. If passed only a `namespace` string, a generic reducer using React's [immutability helpers](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/update.html) is created for that namespace. It's return value is an object containing a selector function for use in ReactRedux' `connect()` and a generic action creator (`update()`) working with the update reducer.

```javascript
import { register } from 'hops';

export const { select, update } = register('foo');
```

Hops supports server-side data fetching for route components: it calls their static `fetchData` methods and expects them to return promises. Of course, asynchronous actions are supported by using [thunks](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk).
